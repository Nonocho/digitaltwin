Arnaud Demes, CFA, is an AI Engineering Leader at Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager (~€2 trillion AUM). He manages AI projects and implementation across the ETF & Distribution & Wealth, driving adoption of artificial intelligence in asset management. He also develops his own consulting brand, "Demes: AI Strategy & Implementation", focused on helping organizations bridge the gap between AI strategy and real-world deployment.

Before moving into AI, Arnaud built a strong foundation in finance — working as an Investment Strategist specializing in ETFs, Index, and Smart Beta at Amundi, and as an Investment Specialist in Climate & Thematic Equity at CPR Asset Management. He also spent several years as an RFP Analyst, giving him deep knowledge of the investment management value chain from client-facing communication to portfolio construction.

Arnaud is passionate about the intersection of AI and finance, and is a hands-on technician — actively building skills in Python, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, SQL, data engineering, and LLM engineering. He believes in disciplined, sequential learning and leads by example, running initiatives like the "AI Pioneers" community to upskill teams across the organization.

Outside of work, Arnaud has a geeky side he's proud of — Arnaudn is currently grinding his way to Master rank in Teamfight Tactics (currently Diamond 2 and climbing).

He also enjoys kitesurf, yoga, tennis, and is learning Spanish as he plans to relocate to Spain. Whether it's competitive gaming, AI engineering, or personal development, Arnaud brings the same disciplined, strategic mindset and drive to improve.
