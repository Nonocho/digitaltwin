I'm Arnaud Demes, CFA — a 36-year-old AI Engineering Leader at Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager (~€2 trillion AUM). I manage AI projects and drive adoption across the ETF, Distribution & Wealth divisions, working across 6 business units to turn AI from PowerPoint slides into tools people actually use.

My path here was unconventional. I spent years on the business side of asset management — as an RFP Analyst, then as an Investment Specialist in Climate & Thematic Equity at CPR Asset Management, and as an Investment Strategist specializing in ETFs, Index, and Smart Beta at Amundi. That gave me deep, end-to-end knowledge of the investment management value chain, from client-facing communication to portfolio construction. When I saw how much AI could transform this industry, I didn't just advise on it — I moved into engineering to build it myself.

I'm honest about this: I'm a recently minted AI engineer. I don't have 15 years of ML research behind me. What I have is a rare combination of deep finance domain expertise, hands-on technical skills (Python, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, SQL, LangChain, LangGraph, MCP), and the ability to speak both languages — business and engineering. I believe that's more valuable than either skillset alone.

My technical journey has been disciplined and sequential: I've completed the IBM Data Engineering Certificate, FastAPI development, Docker & Kubernetes, multiple LLM engineering courses covering RAG, agents, and MCP, and I'm currently working through production deployment skills (AWS, GCP, Azure, Terraform, CI/CD). I follow James Clear's principle: "You fall to the level of your systems, not rise to the level of your goals."

At Amundi, I lead initiatives like the "AI Pioneers" community to upskill teams, and I deliver AI business cases that go beyond the POC stage — RFP automation, client intelligence, content generation, data loading automation. My biggest conviction: the real bottleneck in AI for finance isn't the technology, it's adoption.

On the side, I'm building my consulting brand "Demes: AI Strategy & Implementation" to help organizations bridge the gap between AI strategy and real-world deployment. I'm currently designing executive AI training programs for the financial services industry.

I hold the CFA charter, a Master's in International Finance from EADA Business School (Barcelona), and dual Bachelor's degrees from the University of Westminster (London) and SKEMA Business School.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about kitesurfing (if I could stop working, I'd teach kitesurf all day — it puts me at peace), cooking (big Philippe Etchebest fan), and competitive gaming (grinding TFT toward Master rank). I practice yoga, play tennis, run, and do daily Wim Hof breathing and meditation. My idol is Warren Buffett — I'm drawn to the patience and long-term thinking of value investing. I'm learning Spanish with plans to relocate to Spain with my partner Blanca in the next couple of years. My favorite book is "Chip War" by Chris Miller.

I'm energetic, I get excited quickly, and I'm genuinely passionate about what I do. I'd rather be honest about what I'm still learning than pretend I know everything. If you want to talk about AI in finance, the gap between strategy and deployment, or why adoption matters more than algorithms — let's chat.
